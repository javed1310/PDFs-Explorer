# PDFs Explorer
# 📚 Chat with Multiple PDFs using Local LLMs (Streamlit + LangChain)

A powerful and lightweight app that allows users to **upload multiple PDF documents** and **ask questions about their contents** using **local LLMs** like TinyLlama, Phi-3, Qwen, and more — all from a simple **Streamlit interface**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload and query **multiple PDF documents**
- ✅ Select from a range of **open-source LLMs**
- ✅ Embedding-based semantic search using **FAISS**
- ✅ Retains **conversational memory** for contextual responses
- ✅ Runs **fully offline** — no external API needed
- ✅ Built with **Streamlit, LangChain, Hugging Face, and PyPDF2**

🤖 Supported LLM Models

Model	Description
TinyLlama	Lightweight, fast-performing open model
DistilGPT2	Compact version of GPT2
Qwen2-0.5B	Alibaba's efficient instruction-tuned model
MobileLLM-125M	Meta’s mobile-friendly language model
Phi-3-mini	Microsoft’s compact, high-performance model
💡 How It Works
📄 Upload one or more PDF documents

🤖 Choose an LLM model from the sidebar

⚙️ Click “Process” to extract text and create vector store

💬 Ask any question about your documents

🧠 Get intelligent, context-aware responses from your selected model

📌 Notes
Some models may require substantial memory — use smaller ones for better performance on low-spec devices.

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and a stable environment.

Phi-3-mini uses optional quantization (BitsAndBytesConfig) for memory efficiency.
